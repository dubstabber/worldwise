- **ESLint**: Ensuring code quality and consistency
- **Code Splitting**: Implemented with React.lazy for optimized loading performance

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dubstabber/worldwise

# Navigate to the project directory
cd worldwise

npm run dev
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

WorldWise is built with a modern React architecture:

- **Component-Based Structure**: Modular components for reusability and maintainability
- **Context-Based State Management**: Using React Context API for global state
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracting complex logic into reusable hooks
- **Protected Routes**: Implementing authentication checks for secure access
- **Code Splitting**: Using React.lazy for optimized loading

## üì± Application Flow

1. Users begin at the homepage where they can learn about the application
2. After logging in, they access the main application with the interactive map
3. Users can view their traveled cities and countries in list format
4. Clicking on the map allows adding new cities to their collection
5. Each city can be viewed in detail with notes and visit dates

## üîç Unique Implementation Details

- **Custom Map Interaction**: Enhanced Leaflet integration with custom markers and popups
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented React's Suspense and lazy loading for improved loading times
- **Geolocation Integration**: Seamless browser geolocation API integration
- **Responsive Design Approach**: Adaptable UI for all device sizes

## üìä Future Enhancements

- User authentication with JWT
- Social sharing capabilities
- Travel statistics and visualizations
- Trip planning features
- Photo uploads for each destination
